        "solutions": "Solution 1: Mathematical Approach\nIn this solution, we can use mathematical induction to solve the problem. For n=1, the answer is obviously 1 since we can't do any move. Assume that for any n=k, the smallest number of non-empty piles is p. Then for n=k+1, we can make a move on one pile from the k piles and the new pile, and we get k piles again. By the induction hypothesis, the smallest number of non-empty piles is p. So for any positive integer n, the smallest number of non-empty piles is 1.\n\nSolution 2: Recursive Approach\nIn this solution, we can solve the problem recursively. We start with n piles and try to combine them in pairs progressively until we can't combine them anymore. At each step, we choose two piles, take the same number of pebbles from each pile and form a new pile. The base case is when we have 1 pile left. The recursive case is when we have more than 1 pile. We can use a function to calculate the minimum number of non-empty piles for a given n. The function starts by checking if n is 1. If it is, it returns 1. If it isn't, it calculates the minimum number of non-empty piles for n-1 and adds 1 to the result.\n\nSolution 3: Binary Tree Approach\nIn this solution, we can model the problem as a binary tree. Each node in the tree represents a pile of pebbles. When we choose two piles and form a new pile, we create a new node and make the two chosen piles the child nodes of the new node. The goal is to find a tree with the smallest number of leaf nodes (non-empty piles). We can do this by always choosing the two nodes with the smallest number of pebbles to form a new pile. This ensures that we minimize the number of non-empty piles at each step. After we have formed all possible new piles, the number of leaf nodes in the tree is the smallest number of non-empty piles that we can obtain.",

It does not require the creation of a complex data structure or recursive function, and thus it is the fastest and most straightforward solution. However, it requires a strong understanding of mathematical induction.\n\n2. Recursive Approach - This solution is ranked second due to its scalability. It is capable of solving larger problems by breaking them down into smaller ones, which makes it versatile and practical. However, it could cause a stack overflow for very large values of n.\n\n3. Binary Tree Approach - This solution is ranked third as it provides a visual representation of the problem. This can be helpful for understanding the problem and its solution.

If efficiency is the main concern, the mathematical approach might be the best. If the problem requires understanding of the steps taken to reach the solution, the recursive approach might be preferable. If a visual representation of the problem is important, the binary tree approach might be the best choice.",
