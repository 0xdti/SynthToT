        "solutions": "Solution 1: Mathematical Approach\nIn this solution, we can use mathematical induction to solve the problem. For n=1, the answer is obviously 1 since we can't do any move. Assume that for any n=k, the smallest number of non-empty piles is p. Then for n=k+1, we can make a move on one pile from the k piles and the new pile, and we get k piles again. By the induction hypothesis, the smallest number of non-empty piles is p. So for any positive integer n, the smallest number of non-empty piles is 1.\n\nSolution 2: Recursive Approach\nIn this solution, we can solve the problem recursively. We start with n piles and try to combine them in pairs progressively until we can't combine them anymore. At each step, we choose two piles, take the same number of pebbles from each pile and form a new pile. The base case is when we have 1 pile left. The recursive case is when we have more than 1 pile. We can use a function to calculate the minimum number of non-empty piles for a given n. The function starts by checking if n is 1. If it is, it returns 1. If it isn't, it calculates the minimum number of non-empty piles for n-1 and adds 1 to the result.\n\nSolution 3: Binary Tree Approach\nIn this solution, we can model the problem as a binary tree. Each node in the tree represents a pile of pebbles. When we choose two piles and form a new pile, we create a new node and make the two chosen piles the child nodes of the new node. The goal is to find a tree with the smallest number of leaf nodes (non-empty piles). We can do this by always choosing the two nodes with the smallest number of pebbles to form a new pile. This ensures that we minimize the number of non-empty piles at each step. After we have formed all possible new piles, the number of leaf nodes in the tree is the smallest number of non-empty piles that we can obtain.",

Continue this process until all pairs of piles have been considered.\n\nSolution 2: Dynamic Programming\n\nAnother approach would be to use dynamic programming. Create a table 'dp' where dp[i] represents the minimum number of piles that can be obtained with i pebbles. Initially, dp[i] = i for all i.

We can create an array, dp, where dp[i] stores the smallest number of non-empty piles that can be obtained from i piles. We start with dp[1] = 1, since there is only one pile.

The binary representation of n has a 1 in position i if and only if there is a pile with 2^i pebbles.

        "solutions": "Solution 1: Development and Implementation of Mindfulness Meditation Program\n\nThis solution involves the development and implementation of a structured mindfulness meditation program for college students. The program will involve weekly group sessions led by a trained instructor, with daily individual practices encouraged as well. The mindfulness meditation techniques will be simple, focusing on breath and body awareness, and will be designed to be easily incorporated into students' daily routines. \n\nThe effectiveness of the program will be evaluated by comparing stress levels (measured via a validated stress scale) before and after the program, as well as comparing these results with a control group that does not participate in the program. \n\nThis solution is effective in that it is low-cost and potentially very beneficial to students' mental health. However, it requires commitment from students and a regular time commitment, which may be challenging for some.\n\nSolution 2: Integration of Mindfulness Techniques into Existing Stress Management Strategies \n\nThis solution involves the integration of mindfulness techniques into existing stress management strategies that are already in place for college students, such as counseling services or stress management workshops. For example, counselors could be trained in mindfulness techniques and could incorporate these into their sessions with students. Alternatively, mindfulness could be incorporated into stress management workshops as a technique for students to learn and practice.\n\nThe effectiveness of this solution would be evaluated by comparing stress levels before and after the integration of mindfulness techniques, as well as comparing these results with a control group that does not receive the mindfulness-based interventions. \n\nThis solution has the advantage of being easy to implement and requiring less time commitment from students. However, it may be less effective than a dedicated mindfulness program.\n\nSolution 3: Development of a Mindfulness Meditation App \n\nThis solution involves the development of a mindfulness meditation app specifically designed for college students. The app would include guided meditations, reminders to practice mindfulness, and resources for learning more about mindfulness and its benefits. \n\nThe effectiveness of the app would be evaluated by comparing stress levels before and after the use of the app, as well as comparing these results with a control group that does not use the app.\n\nThis solution has the advantage of being highly accessible and convenient for students, as they can use the app at their own pace and in their own time. However, it may be less effective than a structured program or integrated approach, as it relies on students' individual motivation and commitment.",
